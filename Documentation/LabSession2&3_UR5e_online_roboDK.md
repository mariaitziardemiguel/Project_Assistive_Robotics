## ROBOTICS AND CONTROL OF BIOMEDICAL SYSTEMS
### Robotic arm Universal Robot UR5e
### Laboratory session 2: UR5e Social/Assistive robotic task design

---

Universal Robots is a very reputed robotic company distributing collaborative robots for industrial, research and academic fields.

### The objectives of this laboratory session will be:
* Design challenging assistive robotic tasks with the UR5e robotic arm.
* Review different methods for real-time execution of the assistive robotic tasks from a RoboDK simulation to the real UR5e robot arm.

Simulation (Off-line programming) is an interesting tool enabling the robot task simulation before its real-time execution on the UR5e robot arm.

This session has a previous task to be delivered at the beginning of the session.

## **1. Simple Social task**
The **Task** is the design of challenging assistive robotic tasks with the UR5e robotic arm and the offline simulation using Graphical scripting and Python code integrated into RoboDK.

![RoboDK interface](Images/Session2/figure2.png)

We have made, as an example, 2 different “social” robotic tasks:
* Hand-shake task
* Give-me 5! task

We show you the simulation programs performed using graphical scripting and python code.

To create the proper python code to execute the simulation we have used the function:
`robot.MoveL(target_object_name, True)`

Verify the simulation of the 2 tasks and adapt the code to your own Social/Assistive designed task.


## **2. Real-time execution of the assistive task to the real robot**
Once you have verified that the simulation is working properly, you can proceed with the **real-time execution** of the designed and simulated assistive robotic tasks on the real UR5e robot arm.

We will review 3 different **methods**:
* **Polyscope**: uploading the automatically generated URP or script files to be executed on the robot arm.
* **RoboDK online programming**: the assistive tasks will be executed simultaneously in simulation and in the real robotic arm.
* **Python sockets**: the URScript instructions will be sent to the robot arm within the final python program.

### **2.1. Polyscope**
RoboDK, using Post-Processors, can generate programs to be executed on Polyscope directly from the Teach Pendant:
* `Program.urp`
* `Program.script`

You have to select the post-processor: **Universal Robot URP post-processor**

This gives you the program in absolute coordinates (with respect to the UR5e base). This is the recommended method.

Save the programs on a pen-drive and execute them directly on Polyscope.

### **2.2. RoboDK online programming**
RoboDK can be connected to the real robot arm with an internet cable in a local network.

To proceed you have to:
1.  Connect the computer to the UR5e robot with an ethernet cable.
2.  Fix the IP address on the PC (Network and Internet > Change adapter options > Ethernet properties > TCP/IPv4 protocol).
3.  Fix an IP for the UR5e: `manual mode > settings > network > specify IP and subnet mask`.
4.  Set the Teach Pendant to automatic mode and then select “Remote control”.
5.  Disable the firewall (Public network).

#### Execution using “Menu-bar” options
In this case you need to:
1.  Select “run on robot” (right-click on the program and all subprograms!).
2.  Connect to the UR5e robot (right-click on the robot).
3.  Select “Get position” to fix the RoboDK robot POSE to the real/actual UR5e POSE.

When you run the “MainProgram”, the real robot moves simultaneously with the simulation.

Run the pick & place program from RoboDK and the real UR5 robot will perform the movements.

#### Execution within python code
You can create a python code to fully control the simple task `Assistive_hand_SW.py` process. The options you have selected in the “Menu-bar” have their specific function in the RoboDK library:
- You only have to add a function to choose between Software (SW) or Hardware (HW) execution.

- Robot speed is fixed with `robot.setSpeed(xx)`.

- Simulation robot speed is fixed with the popup slider.

- The adapted version corresponds to the `Assistive_hand_SW_HW.py` code.

### **2.3. Python sockets**
At the Script Level, URScript is the programming language that controls the robot. The URScript includes variables, types, and flow control statements. There are also built-in variables and functions that monitor and control I/O and robot movements.

The URScript instructions can be sent to the robot arm within a final python program using the sockets python library to establish a reliable connection to the robot. To execute a URScript-based project directly with your PC and python, you'll need to establish a socket connection to send and receive commands and data to/from the robot.

Here's a general outline of the process:

a) **Set Up Socket Communication**: In Python, you can use the `socket` module to establish a socket connection with the robot's controller. You'll need to know the IP address and port number of the robot controller to establish this connection..
```python
import socket

robot_ip = '192.168.1.5'  # Replace with the actual robot's IP address
robot_port = 30002       # Default port for UR robots

# Create a socket object
robot_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to the robot controller
robot_socket.connect((robot_ip, robot_port))
```

b) Translate URScript to Python: Convert your URScript code into Python code that sends the equivalent commands over the socket connection. For example, a URScript movel command to move the robot to a specific joint configuration like this:

````Python
urscript_command = "movej([1.0, -2.0, 3.0, -4.0, 5.0, -6.0], a=1.0, v=0.1)\n"
# Send the URScript command to the robot
robot_socket.send(urscript_command.encode())
````

c) Handle Responses: After sending commands, you may need to receive and process responses from the robot controller. If we do not need response information we will wait a short period of time (the desired execution time).

````Python
response = robot_socket.recv(1024)
print(response.decode())  # Decode and print the response
````

d) Close the Socket: It's essential to close the socket when you're done.

````Python
robot_socket.close()
````
The adapted first version corresponds to the `Assistive_hand_SW_HW_sockets.py` code.

## **3. Assistive/Social robotic task dessign**

The objective is for each laboratory group to design an original Assistive/Social robotic task.

**Activity**

Take the simple task template (Assistive_hand_SW.py) we deliver to you and make the necessary changes to adapt it to your custom designed social/assistive Task. 

**Delivery**:
- Each Student has to upload the video of his custom designed Social/Assistive robotic task simulated on roboDK.
- The project has to contain:
    - the original Assistive/Social robotic task in a `Custom_Assistive_SW.py` file on `pyhon_scripts` folder 
    - and `Custom_Assistive_UR5e.rdk` file on `roboDK` folder.

## **Laboratory development**

During the first hour of the laboratory session, students will see a demonstration of the 3 methods from a professor's demo project in RoboDK.

During the second hour, students will adapt and generate the proper and obtimised code for their Social-Assistive designed task. 

**Suggestions**: 
- You can improve and automate your code if you use:
    - For moveJ:
        ```python
        j1, j2, j3, j4, j5, j6 = np.radians(Target.Joints()).tolist()[0]
        movej_Target = f"movej([{j1},{j2}, {j3}, {j4}, {j5}, {j6}],{accel_mss},{speed_ms},{time_high},{blend_r})"
        ```
    - For moveL:
        ```python
        X, Y, Z, Roll, Pitch, Yaw = Pose_2_TxyzRxyz(Target.Pose())
        movel_Target = f"movel(p[{X}, {Y}, {Z}, {Roll}, {Pitch}, {Yaw}], a={accel_mss}, v={speed_ms}, t={timel}, r={blend_r})"
        ````
- Try an OOP approach with a class RobotUR5e with atributes and methods.

**Objectives:**
- All the group members have to contribute to the final solution (with github project sync updates)
- demonstration tests have to be done with the real UR5e robot arm.
- This has to be done during sessions 2 and 3.
- The final presentation will be done in session 4
